# Smart Security Gate with ESP8266 and Flutter Mobile App

A Smart Security Gate system using an ESP8266 microcontroller and a Flutter mobile app. This project provides secure gate access control via a user-friendly mobile application.

## Key Features

- **ESP8266 Integration**: Wireless communication and control.
- **Mobile App**: Built with Flutter for remote gate control.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live gate status updates on the app.
- **Security**: Secure gate access through authenticated users.

## Components

- **Hardware**: ESP8266 microcontroller, sensors, actuators.
- **Software**: 
  - Firmware for ESP8266
  - Flutter mobile app

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
